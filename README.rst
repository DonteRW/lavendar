The Land Variational Ensemble Data Assimilation fRamework (LaVEnDAR)
====================================================================

The Land Variational Ensemble Data Assimilation fRamework (LaVEnDAR) implements the method of Four-Dimensional
Ensemble Variational data assimilation for land surface models. In this README we show an example of implementing
4DEnVar with the JULES land surface model to perform a twin experiment.
